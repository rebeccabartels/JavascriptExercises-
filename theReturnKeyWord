//This function returns a value equal to one quarter of the parameter. (i.e. number / 4;)
//Call the function inside the if statement's condition (and put in a parameter value!) 
//such that "The statement is true" is printed to the console.

//On line 7, the if statement's condition calls the function! It needs you to put in number value.
//Recall % is modulo. It gives you the remainder when one number is divided by another.
//eg. 13 % 3 is 1.
//We want quarter(some number) that when divided by 3 has remainder 0.
